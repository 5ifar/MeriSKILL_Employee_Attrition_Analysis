This repository serves as my documentation for the MeriSKILL HR Attrition Analysis - Power BI Project.

It was created as a learning project as part of my Internship assignment at: [MeriSKILL](https://sites.google.com/view/meriskill/home) during May - June 2024.

It showcases my competancy to work with Microsoft Power BI and demonstrates my proficiency in essential Power BI concepts like Data Profiling, ETL with Power Query, Semantic Data Modelling, DAX Measures & DAX Calculated Columns, Dashboard Designing, Visualization, Conditional Formating, Filters, Bookmarks, Page Navigation, Publishing and Report Optimization etc.

The entire project has been implemented using Microsoft Power BI Desktop 2.128.751.0 and published on Microsoft Power BI Service.

## Purpose:
In this report we navigate through the core of HR Analytics, from meticulous data collection to the art of deriving actionable insights from employee attrition data. It involves identifying patterns and optimizing processes that breathes life into our organizational strategies.

HR analytics, also known as Human Resources analytics or talent analytics, is the systematic application of data analysis and statistical methods to human resources data. It involves gathering and analyzing data related to an organization’s workforce to make informed decisions and drive improvements in HR processes, policies, and strategies. The primary goal of HR analytics is to optimize the performance, engagement, and overall effectiveness of an organization’s workforce.

By leveraging HR analytics effectively, organizations can align their human resources strategies with business objectives, enhance organizational performance, and create a more engaged and productive workforce. It’s about leveraging data to make informed decisions that impact both employees and the organization positively.
