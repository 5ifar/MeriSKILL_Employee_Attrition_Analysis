### Purpose:
In this report we navigate through the core of HR Analytics, from meticulous data collection to the art of deriving actionable insights from employee attrition data. It involves identifying patterns and optimizing processes that breathes life into our organizational strategies.

HR analytics, also known as Human Resources analytics or talent analytics, is the systematic application of data analysis and statistical methods to human resources data. It involves gathering and analyzing data related to an organizationâ€™s workforce to make informed decisions and drive improvements in HR processes, policies, and strategies. The primary goal of HR analytics is to optimize the performance, engagement, and overall effectiveness of an organizationâ€™s workforce.

By leveraging HR analytics effectively, organizations can align their human resources strategies with business objectives, enhance organizational performance, and create a more engaged and productive workforce. Itâ€™s about leveraging data to make informed decisions that impact both employees and the organization positively.
