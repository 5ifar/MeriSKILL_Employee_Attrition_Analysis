### Step 1: Creating Measures Table

- To collect all report measures in a single place we‚Äôll create a measures table to store all the measures together.
- Data View ‚Üí Enter Data ‚Üí Rename as measure.

### Step 2: Key Measures

- `Total Emp = COUNT('Employee Attrition'[EmployeeNumber])`
- `Attrited Emp = CALCULATE([Total Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Attrition]="Yes")`
- `Active Emp = [Total Emp] - [Attrited Emp]`
- `Male Emp = CALCULATE([Total Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Gender]="Male")`
- `Female Emp = [Total Emp] - [Male Emp]`
- `Male Attrited Emp = CALCULATE([Attrited Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Gender]="Male")`
- `Female Attrited Emp = [Attrited Emp] - [Male Attrited Emp]`
- `Male Active Emp = CALCULATE([Active Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Gender]="Male")`
- `Female Active Emp = [Active Emp] - [Male Active Emp]`
- `Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Attrited Emp], [Total Emp], 0)`
- `Male Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Male Attrited Emp], [Male Emp], 0)`
- `Female Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Female Attrited Emp], [Female Emp], 0)`
- `Avg Age = AVERAGE('Employee Attrition'[Age])`
- `Median Monthly Income = MEDIAN('Employee Attrition'[MonthlyIncome])`
- `Average Monthly Income = AVERAGE('Employee Attrition'[MonthlyIncome])`
- `Avg Tenure = AVERAGE('Employee Attrition'[YearsAtCompany])`

### Step 3: Employee Age Category vs Attrition Trend Visual

- This divides the Emp stats across 4 categories: Young Adult (18-25 age), Adult (26-44 age), Middle-age Adult (45-55 age), Old-age Adult (56+ age)
- Enable Data Labels and apply Active Emp - Attrited Emp - Attrition Rate Color formatting.
