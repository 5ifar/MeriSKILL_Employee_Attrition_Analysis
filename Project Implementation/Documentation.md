## Phase 1: ETL with Power Query

### Step 1: Extraction & Transforming Data:

- Extract Data: Get Data ‚Üí Text/CSV ‚Üí HR Employee Attrition.csv ‚Üí Transform Data
- Business Travel column Categorization changed: Non-Travel ‚Üí Never, Travel_Rarely ‚Üí Rarely, Travel_Frequently ‚Üí Frequently
- Age group Categorization column created: Young adult (18-25 age), Adult (26-44 age), Middle-age (45-55 age), Old age (56+ age) about four sequential patterns using Conditional Column.
- Deleted EmployeeCount and Over18 columns as every employee count is 1 and all employees are above 18, so not useful data for analysis.
- EducationLevel Conditional column: Categorized as 1 ‚Üí High school, 2 ‚Üí College degree, 3 ‚Üí Bachelors, 4 ‚Üí Masters , 5 ‚Üí Doctorate
- Add ‚ÄúMS-‚Äù i.e MeriSKILL prefix to the Employee Number column. Changed data type to Text.

### Step 1: Creating Measures Table:

- To collect all report measures in a single place we‚Äôll create a measures table to store all the measures together.
- Data View ‚Üí Enter Data ‚Üí Rename as measure.

### Step 2: Key Measures:

- `Total Emp = COUNT('Employee Attrition'[EmployeeNumber])`
- `Attrited Emp = CALCULATE([Total Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Attrition]="Yes")`
- `Active Emp = [Total Emp] - [Attrited Emp]`
- `Male Emp = CALCULATE([Total Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Gender]="Male")`
- `Female Emp = [Total Emp] - [Male Emp]`
- `Male Attrited Emp = CALCULATE([Attrited Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Gender]="Male")`
- `Female Attrited Emp = [Attrited Emp] - [Male Attrited Emp]`
- `Male Active Emp = CALCULATE([Active Emp], 'Employee Attrition'[Gender]="Male")`
- `Female Active Emp = [Active Emp] - [Male Active Emp]`
- `Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Attrited Emp], [Total Emp], 0)`
- `Male Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Male Attrited Emp], [Male Emp], 0)`
- `Female Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([Female Attrited Emp], [Female Emp], 0)`
- `Avg Age = AVERAGE('Employee Attrition'[Age])`
- `Median Monthly Income = MEDIAN('Employee Attrition'[MonthlyIncome])`
- `Average Monthly Income = AVERAGE('Employee Attrition'[MonthlyIncome])`
- `Avg Tenure = AVERAGE('Employee Attrition'[YearsAtCompany])`
